# TicTacSlide
I decided to change up the game rules and bit and have the player click on a green tile and slide to yellow tile
to place thire marker

on you're turn you can chose to add a new marker to the game or move and existing one

markers pushed off the map are out of the game

a player wins once only one player has 3 in a row
